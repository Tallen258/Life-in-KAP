Updated Working Version:

Board ← (boardSize÷2) ⌽ (boardSize÷2) ⊖ boardSize boardSize ↑ walker

Board (life Board) (life life Board)



--------------------------------------------
I spent a couple hours trying to get the colors to show up
for the right cells. I tried a few different ways, but I ran into
strange errors every time. Below is one of my nonfunctional versions;
maybe you'll be able to see where I'm going wrong.
